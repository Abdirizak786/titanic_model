# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project is part of a **Corporate Training in Data Science and AI**. It involves building and deploying a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using features like age, sex, class, etc.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Flask (for backend deployment)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Features include `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`.

## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding
   - Scaling and normalizing data

2. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees
   - Cross-validation and model tuning

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix

4. **Deployment**
   - Built a simple UI with Streamlit
   - Flask used for API backend
